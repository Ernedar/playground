## What Is Playground?
Truth to be told, I really like coding. Better than programming itself. I like that I can see project growing under my hands. I started playing with web pages on middle school. That was 15 years ago. From that time, CSS, HTML and Javascript immensely evolved, and it will evolve till somebody will be interested in it. Playground is here to let me and maybe even you evolve with sort of free hands and some tools in your hands for that evolution.

In 2015 I started as a junior coder in small company that mainly specialized on small client webs for small money. Bootstrap will be the first thing that will slip to everybody's mind. You are not far. Bootstrap was first thing I was working with heavily as a coder. And it was... Pain. 

So much pain that one day I started working on my own branch of something like boostrap. I was pissed on grid and its limitations, on carousel that was so not flexible that you needed !importants to change its properties. On menu where 4 classes were circles before the menu finished its animation, not speaking about that pile of crap I was required to use to have one button in responsive menu.

I started stripping it. In the end I started to rewrite those components to have them as I liked not as everybody else will have them when using Bootstrap.

First version of this repository was born in next 4 months where I scratched the almighty Bootstrap entirely and started again. It worked.

Do not get me wrong. Bootstrap is genius thing, but not for webs that need to be agile and by the design you are provided by graphics designer of the web. All in all you will be rewriting parts of bootstrap even if you want different menu behavior.

Playground is suitable name. Why? Because this system will not give you components. Yet. But it will give you components to play with.

Imagine it like this: You have sandbox and booststrap is like your play tools that are limited of what you can do with them. Playground on the other hand is tool that will tell you: "How do you need your tools to look like to play with them?".
If you want fast solution for backend visualization and you need it done fast, this is not place for you. Go play with Bootstrap. But if you want to save some time and still need that design face of your web done, I have right tools for you. But not yet. In time...

So sit down and start playing. Enjoy!
